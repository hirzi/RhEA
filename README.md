# Range Expansion and Adaptation

  This repository contains code for performing demographic inference, running distribution models, visualizing shifts in environmental space, performing gradient forest and calculating glacial genomic offsets; as included in the paper "Climate-induced range shifts drive adaptive response via spatio-temporal sorting of alleles" (Luqman et al. 2022; https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.07.495159v1).

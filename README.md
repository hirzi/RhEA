# Range Expansion and Adaptation

  This repository contains code for performing demographic inference, running distribution models, visualizing shifts in environmental space, performing gradient forest and calculating glacial genomic offsets, as performed in the paper "Climate-induced range shifts drive adaptive response via spatio-temporal sorting of alleles" (Luqman et al. 2022).
